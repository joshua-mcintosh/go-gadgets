# Go Gadgets - Learning Toys
Go-gadgets is based on a scratchpad of projects I'd like to work on. The
inspiration is that I'd like to get better at using the Go programming language,
but I wanted some practical applications to figure things out. To that end, I've
set this up to give it a try.

Note that these projects will likely range from simple to complicated, but I'm
hoping not too complicated.

Some project ideas in mind:

* Get and print (one|many) random bash.org entries. I envisioned both a
  command interface and an http handler for serving up random quotes.
* Get and print info (including name, url last commit message and link, \# forks
  and stars on the most (starred|forked|active) GitHub go projects:
    - under 1000 lines
    - in the last week
* Build a static blog generator (or if I'm lazy, figure out how to use one).
* Build a web server to serve said blog and possibly some additional http
  Handlers.
* comment engine for the blog (not sure if this is advised or feasible?)
* A web-based chat room, providing real-time updates across browsers.
